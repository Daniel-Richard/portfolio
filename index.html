<h4>Thanks for visiting.</h4>

<p1>I'm Kel, a user experience and product designer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am dedicated to creating experiences that enrich the lives of others through human-centered design. I'm passionate about creating products that empower individuals to live healthy lives, both physically and mentally and products that foster communication and community. I believe that great design is created when users are at the heart of the design process. </p1>

<p1>I love technology because of its immediacy and ability to engage so many different types of audiences.  I want to create digital products that bring a high level of value into people's lives.</p1>

<p1>In the past, I have designed objects as diverse as wall-covering for a hospital in Qatar while working in a Chelsea loft in NYC and column covers for a casino in Nevada while working at a factory in East Oakland. My diverse experience as a designer and background in manufacturing has given me a deep appreciation for the products that make up our everyday lives. </p1>

<p1>When I'm not designing, you can find me collecting new hobbies like making kimchi, practicing archery, studying the Enneagram or volunteering my time at local women's right organizations.</p1>
